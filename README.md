This is an ancient board game that has been played by generations for yorns. The implementations of the game will be in Elixir using the infamous Module from Phoenix, LiveView.

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
